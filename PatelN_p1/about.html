            <label for="toggle1"><h2>Why should I buy purified or spring water instead of drinking tap water?</h2></label>
            <section>
              <p>Many people choose purified or spring drinking water over tap water because purified and spring water don't contain the chemicals, such as chlorine and fluoride, that tap water does. Our purified water and spring water are also free of dangerous heavy metals such as lead that can be found in some tap water. Health concerns aside though, the biggest reason that people choose bottled water over tap water is the pure and clean taste. The better your water tastes the more you will drink and everyone knows these days that water is the bodies' most important nutrient.</p>

            <section>
              <p>The Watersafe bottle system features a special spill-proof bottle cap that means no one ever has to wrestle with the neck of the bottle, so hand germs will never find their way into the dispenser. Each cap has a hygienic label on top that you'll peel off just before you place the bottle on the dispenser. When you turn the bottle over, the cap will remain completely sealed-nothing will spill out. Once you put the bottle on the cooler, a feed tube inside the cooler will automatically pop open a valve in the cap through which the water will be dispensed. NO MORE WET WALLS AND FLOORS!</p>

            <section>
              <p>Our water is purified by a state of the art multi-stage purification system. One of the stages is reverse osmosis purification. The process begins with a filter that collects large particles and sediment, followed by activated carbon filters that trap chlorine and other chemicals. Then the water passes through a reverse osmosis membrane, which allows water molecules through but not larger compounds. The result is almost 100% pure H2O. Our water has as few as 3 parts per million total dissolved solids, while tap water typically has 400 to 600 ppm.</p>
